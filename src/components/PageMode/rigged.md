If you want to break the norm and place copyright information in a more creative, strategic position while maintaining functionality, here are some alternative suggestions:

---

### **1. Sidebar/Vertical Edge**  
- Place the copyright notice vertically along the left or right edge of the screen.  
- It stays visible but out of the way, adding a modern touch.  
- Example:  
  ```
  | © 2024 EdgeFlow Inc.
  |
  ```

---

### **2. Header Integration**  
- Incorporate the copyright notice subtly into the top navigation bar or header, alongside the logo or tagline.  
- This works well for minimalist designs where every detail adds personality.  

---

### **3. Watermark in the Background**  
- Display it as a semi-transparent watermark in the page's background, giving it a unique but non-intrusive presence.  
- Example: At the bottom-right corner of the background, diagonally across the page.  

---

### **4. Sticky Floating Element**  
- Add it as a small sticky badge or icon in the bottom-right or bottom-left corner of the viewport.  
- Clicking or hovering expands it to show detailed copyright/legal info.  

---

### **5. Integrated into Call-to-Action Areas**  
- Combine copyright info with call-to-action sections like a "Contact Us" or "About" button in the footer or header.  
- Example:  
  `© 2024 EdgeFlow Inc. | Learn More`

---

### **6. Footer Widget Area (But Dynamically Visible)**  
- Instead of a static footer, display the copyright info as part of an animated footer widget or collapsible section.  
- Example: A toggleable "Legal" tab expands when clicked.

---

### **7. Within the Scroll Progress Bar**  
- Embed the copyright information into a horizontal scroll progress indicator at the top or bottom of the page.  
- Example:  
  `© 2024 EdgeFlow Inc.` appears within or below the progress bar.  

---

### **8. Middle of the Page in a Stylish Divider**  
- Place it as part of a horizontal rule/divider in the middle of the content, making it a statement piece rather than an afterthought.  

---

### **9. Tooltip on Hoverable Elements**  
- Attach the copyright info to a frequently hovered-over element, such as the logo, in a tooltip.  

---

### **10. Footer Reinvention: Center-Aligned**  
- Instead of small text at the bottom-left/right, make the footer prominent with bold typography, placed at the center of the page's footer.  
- Example: A single prominent line:  
  `This site is © 2024 EdgeFlow Inc.`
